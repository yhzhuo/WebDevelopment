				What is UWexchanger?	
			</p>
			<p>
				Hello everyone, I’m Phoenix, the 
				founder of this FOREVER FREE powerful courses registration tool. 
				Now, I will introduce you this wonderful tool. At the beginning of instruction, let me ask you some questions. Did you experience that the courses you hope to 
				register are already full? Did you refresh the courses SLN page again and again at 
				1 a.m. but still cannot get the spare place? Did you take uninteresting courses 
				in a quarter just because of these two problems?
				<br />
				However, these problems usually result from lacking of communication. For example, you hope to take CSE 142, which is already full. At the same time, you have already registered MATH 124, 
				which you don’t hope to take any more. However, you still don’t hope to drop MATH 124, because you know that dropping MATH 124 don’t mean that you can get CSE 142, and you also know that some other people are spying at MATH 124’s free places. If you drop it, you 
				may need to say good bye to MATH 124 this quarter. At the same time, another UW student in a remote place has already occupied the place of CSE 142 but what he or she actually wants is your MATH 124 place! So, if you two really know each other’s demand, and can communicate with each other without any problems, you can record the SLN of 
				that student&#39;s CSE 142, then drop MATH 124, and that student drop CSE 142, 
				record SLN of MATH 124 at the same time. Then, both of you two register CSE 142 
				or MATH 126 QUICKLY. Finally, both of you two get the courses you need!!!
				<br />
				In the past, this fantastic miracle would not happen, because it is impossible for you to ask all other UW students about if they occupy the courses you need but need the courses occupied by you. But, now, our mighty UWexchanger helps you make this dream come true! What you need to do is just telling UWexchanger what courses you need but don’t have and what courses you have but don’t need, and your contact information. Then, the UWexchanger can help you find the students who need the courses you have and have the courses you need. When you see this, you can contact with them directly and get the courses you need!!!
