	What is UWexchanger?
	
</p>

<p>
Hello everyone, welcome to The UWexchanger! I’m Phoenix, the founder of this FOREVER FREE powerful courses registration tool. 
Now, I will introduce you this wonderful tool. If you already know the essencial 
information about it, you can click <a href="index.php">here</a> and start to use it directly 
or <a href="register.php" >Sign Up</a>. At the beginning of instruction, let me ask you some questions. Did you experience that the courses you hope to 
register are already full? Did you refresh the courses SLN page again and again at 
1 a.m. but still cannot get the spare place? Did you take uninteresting courses 
in a quarter just because of these two problems?
<br />
However, these problems usually result from lacking of communication. For example, you hope to take CSE 142, which is already full. At the same time, you have already registered MATH 124, 
which you don’t hope to take any more. However, you still don’t hope to drop MATH 124, because you know that dropping MATH 124 don’t mean that you can get CSE 142, and you also know that some other people are spying at MATH 124’s free places. If you drop it, you 
may need to say good bye to MATH 124 this quarter. At the same time, another UW student in a remote place has already occupied the place of CSE 142 but what he or she actually wants is your MATH 124 place! So, if you two really know each other’s demand, and can communicate with each other without any problems, you can record the SLN of 
that student&#39;s CSE 142, then drop MATH 124, and that student drop CSE 142, 
record SLN of MATH 124 at the same time. Then, both of you two register CSE 142 
or MATH 126 QUICKLY. Finally, both of you two get the courses you need!!!
<br />
In the past, this fantastic miracle would not happen, because it is impossible for you to ask all other UW students about if they occupy the courses you need but need the courses occupied by you. But, now, our mighty UWexchanger helps you make this dream come true! What you need to do is just telling UWexchanger what courses you need but don’t have and what courses you have but don’t need, and your contact information. Then, the UWexchanger can help you find the students who need the courses you have and have the courses you need. When you see this, you can contact with them directly and get the courses you need!!!
</p>

<p class="title"><a name="HowToUse"> </a>How to use UWexchanger?</p>

<p>
Firstly, you need to register at <a href="http://www.uwexchanger.com/register.php">http://www.uwexchanger.com/register.php</a>. Note, you MUST use your UW email address to register it. We recommend you fill in the information about what courses you need , and what courses you don’t need 
in the two tables below. It will make you feel easier to use UWexchanger in the future. 
Note, <b>never type in SLN!!!</b> The reason is that just like schedule finder 
of UW, our system never use SLN to match courses. Additionally, you&#39;d better 
also type in your current situation and contact information (<b>Phone Number 
Recommended!!!</b>) below these two tables, it will help other users find you 
quickly<br />
<img border="0" src="http://students.washington.edu/yz48/uwexchanger_img/instru4.jpg"><br />
When you register it successfully, the page will jump to the swapping control panel.
<br />
<img border="0" src="http://students.washington.edu/yz48/uwexchanger_img/instru5.jpg" alt"Main description picture"><br />
If there is already someone who matches your need that recorded in our system, you can see their whole information, including what they can provide you and what you 
should provide them and their contact information. Then you can contact with them and get the courses you need.
(1)<br /><br />
If you cannot find someone who matches your need, don’t feel said, just click on the refresh button 
(5) and see if there are someone who matches, because someone who matches your need may probably post their information just after you. You can also close the webpage and 
open it again after few minutes. Sometimes, others will contact you before you see the webpage again.
<br /><br />
When you get the courses you need, you’d better delete your request about these courses. If others 
get your courses, you should also delete your information about &quot;you have but don’t need&quot; those courses. Why, because if you don’t do like that, some people may bother you for the courses you have already given to others. 
If you hope to delete a request, just check the check box on the left side of 
the course information (3) .Besides that, if you have some new request for some courses or you begin to unlike another course you have, you can also add the new information.
<br /><br />
<a name="HowToAddAndDelete">&nbsp;</a>
Now, you may ask, how to add and delete the information about courses? It&#39;s 
easy! Do you remember how you add and drop courses in UW courses registration page? Just choose the courses you hope to drop, and type in the SLN of the courses you hope to register, then click on the button “Update Schedule” right? In UWexchanger, you do the same thing. The only difference is that what you type in is 
<b>not SLN</b>, but the courses’ <b>Curriculum Abbreviation</b>, <b>Number</b> and 
<b>Section</b> in the places of “Add the courses I need” or “Add the courses I don’t need” that correspond to them. For example for “CSE 142 A” the Curriculum Abbreviation is CSE, the Number is 142, the Section is A. 
<br /><br />
<b>There
are two important things you need to know!!!</b> First, when you type in your 
new courses requests, or check on the requests that you hope to delete, they 
haven&#39;t been added or deleted. You need to click on the button &quot;Change 
Courses!!!&quot; (7) that below two tables. Then the system can do all the jobs for 
you.

<br /><img border="0" src="http://students.washington.edu/yz48/uwexchanger_img/instru5_2.jpg"><br />

<br /><br />
Secondly If you do not need to type in the specific section of a course you 
need, don&#39;t type! The reason is that our system will try to only present you 
others course request information that not only relate to the specific courses 
but also related to the specific section, which sometimes will be very rare.&nbsp; 
<br /><br />
However, updating your contact information is a little different. You need to write these in the 
&quot;My situation &amp; how to contact me:&quot; box, and then click the &quot;Change 
Situation&quot; button 
below it.<br />

<p class="title">Useful tips to use UWexchanger</p>

<p>
1: <b>Phone number</b> is the best contact method, because you and your exchanging partner can directly talk in phone and drop, and add, which is very convenient.
<br />
2: During the exchanging process, please all record the SLNs first then do the adding and dropping, because you should do this as quickly as possible, or other students who are also looking for these courses may rub the places that you deserve to get.
<br />
3: Don’t type the courses information too specific or too general. Too general information may let the system provide some irrelevant people to you, whereas too specific information may let the system ignore the people who may fit in your demand. So, if you hope to get “CSE 142 A”, you’d better type in “CSE 142”, which may let the system show people who can provide you “CSE 142 B”. Then, you may find that “CSE 142 B” also fit in your demand.
<br />
4: Our system will show you up to 20 people in one page, which means that some valuable information may hide in the second or third or other pages. So, you can click the 
green padding &quot;Show more&quot; below the list of the courses request information to see 
more results. However, if it changes into gary padding with words &quot;No more!!!&quot;, 
all results are presented in your browser. One important thing is that the people in the bottom place of a page or the people in the back pages are always 
relatively irrelevant to your demand or don’t consider their courses in the 
exchanger for long time.
<br />
5: If you cannot find the people who match you for a long time but still don’t give up, you can try to update the information you put in our system a little. For example add a semicolon in your contact information, and so on. This method is used to make your 
information tend to appear in the front pages, but remember, do NOT always do like this, or others may bothered by you.
<br />
6: Sometimes, you just hope to get the courses you need but do not to give up any of your courses. In this situation, you can still leave the 
&quot;what you have but don&#39;t need&quot; blank. However, if you do like this, probably you 
cannot get the courses you need.</p>

<p class="title">Notices:</p>

<p>
1: It’s your responsibility if you lose your courses but don’t get the courses you need when you exchange with others, because the UWexchanger is only a platform to 
transmit information and it is you and your exchanging partner who actually participate in dropping and adding courses.
<br />
2: Do not try to FRAUD courses. If you don’t have the courses others need, don’t lie. Firstly, lying is immoral; secondly, if you lie to that 
other, and get the courses they don’t need, they may still turn back to the 
courses you fraud from them if they still cannot register the courses they need, which means that you and a person who is harmed by you may become classmates. If that happen, will that one......  :-(    Open your imagination. All in all, if you really feel that the courses you need 
and drop are all very important to you and you must avoid any kinds of fraud, you two can meet and exchange the courses face to face.
<br />
3: UWexchanger does NOT affiliate to University of Washington and any systems or agencies relate to it.
